// Decision 0003: trusted, versioned native extraction-input inventories.

// An artifact's own `extractionInputs` is a claim, never the authority. Normalization and
// checking compare it with the inventory declared here for the producer's exact
// (id, version) and the document's language, and fail closed when that producer version or
// language has no declaration or the claim differs. A producer that starts reading another
// input must ship under a new version with a new entry; it can never re-declare its inventory
// under an existing version.
