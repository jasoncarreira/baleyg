# Rust adapter slice

Implement .rs indexing and sequence browsing in the existing language-neutral graph/SequenceView.
Use tree-sitter-rust and cached source. Indexing must never execute cargo, rustc, build.rs, or
macros. Trusted Baleyg development builds/tests remain allowed. No provider calls or schema migration.

Indexer owns src/indexer.rs, src/indexer_rust.rs, tests/rust_indexer.rs.
Behavior owns src/behavior_rust.rs, tests/rust_behavior.rs.
Root owns Cargo dependency/lock, lib registration, behavior dispatch, HTTP support reasons,
integration tests, docs and deployment. Preserve JS functionality.

language=rust; callable Symbol ranges are whole AST function_item/closure_expression nodes.
Impl methods are Method; free functions Function; containers use existing Module/Class kinds.
Trait signatures without bodies must not acquire fabricated behavior. Closures have independent
ownership; their bodies do not run at definition. Macro token trees are opaque boundaries,
not ordinary calls. Attributes/cfg/module ambiguity must remain explicit. Async function body
models possible execution when polled, not future construction. No compiler/type/trait-resolution
claims. Prefer unresolved calls to unsafe name matching. IDs, ranges, owners, provenance retained.
Call ordinal is source order, NOT execution order.

Behavior: receiver/argument evaluation before calls, if/iflet/match with guards, loops without
unrolling, short-circuit, return, ? early exit, await, mutations. Unsupported transfers, labels,
patterns, unsafe constructs, macros, async blocks and closure bodies may be explicit source-linked
boundaries. Never flatten alternatives or render a suffix unconditionally after possible exits.
Names/receivers are visual hints, NOT object identity or inferred method dispatch.
Bounds:200steps/20participants/depth24, warnings/truncation/provenance. No Rust importance filter.

Tests: mixed JS/Rust discovery, functions/impl/closures/macros/UTF8/recovery, cached source;
behavior nested order, branches/match/loops/?/await/return/boundaries. Validate real src/auth.rs
function valid_token and a larger method. No external source commands during indexing.
