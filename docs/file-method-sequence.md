# File → method → sequence

> Current language update: native Java and Python navigation/static sequences are now available.
> See [support and boundaries](java-python-support.md). Historical first-pass limits below remain dated.

The primary workflow is an indexed file tree. Expand a file to see its methods inline,
then choose a method to view a source-linked static sequence diagram alongside the tree.
No provider call is required. Existing question tools and the outgoing call hierarchy
remain available separately.

## Evidence and architecture

The renderer consumes a shared `SequenceView` behavior representation, not JavaScript
syntax nodes. In this first slice, a JavaScript adapter derives that representation from
**cached indexed source** and measured call-site identities. It does not read or execute
the live workspace. This is a compatibility bridge until behavior facts are persisted by
language adapters at index time; the current call graph alone is not enough to infer
execution structure.

Branches, loops, exceptional paths and nested evaluation must remain explicit. Callback
and nested-function declarations are not calls. Unresolved callees remain boundaries.
Unsupported control constructs must produce a warning/boundary rather than invented
behavior. This is a static possible-path view, not a runtime trace or concurrency proof.

## Filtering

The initial filters are conservative local heuristics, not model-based semantic judgments.
Show-all controls expose filtered methods and steps. Do not equate zero outgoing calls
with an inconsequential method: validation, computation and state changes can matter without
calling anything. Selection quality and broader language support remain separate gates.

## Scope

Language-neutral navigation, DTOs and rendering; JavaScript adapter initially. Bounded
snapshot-consistent file catalog and method/sequence routes, explicit stale-state handling,
source links, and contained diagram scrolling. No automatic indexing or inference.

[Implementation contract](sequence-slice-contract.md).


## Current filtering limits

Method lists retain all indexed functions/methods, including accessors and zero-call checks:
there is no semantic method-importance classifier yet. The show-all method control is ready
for retention hints, but the current backend does not hide methods without evidence.
For sequence steps, only standalone `console.log` / `console.debug` wrappers are hidden by
an explicitly labelled naming heuristic. Their argument effects and calls used in guards
remain; Show all steps restores the wrappers. Other effects stay visible.

Complex loop transfers, unsupported patterns and optional-chain operations may appear as
source-linked boundaries rather than expanded behavior. These limits are explicit; the
adapter must not invent a straight-line execution order for them.
