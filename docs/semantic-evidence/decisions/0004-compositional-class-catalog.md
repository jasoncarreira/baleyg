# Decision 0004: two-step class catalog (per-file extraction, per-revision composition)

- **Status:** approved by the owner on 2026-10-01; ratified when this record merges. It changes normative text in `../../class-diagram-contract.md`. It changes no deployed schema by itself; implementation follows in #67 (see [Implementation impact](#implementation-impact)).
- **Scope:** how the Java/Python class catalog (`Catalog`, `src/classes.rs`) is built and persisted. The class DTOs, IDs, relation kinds, scoped-matching rules, HTTP API and class-diagram behaviour are unchanged.
- **Compatibility: none.** Pre-release, the owner requires no backward compatibility. Catalog output may differ from the current build **only** when a workspace-wide cap is reached (see [Behaviour change](#behaviour-change)).

## Problem

`Catalog::build` is one pass over every Java/Python file in path order. Each file's extraction draws on budgets shared by the whole workspace:

| Shared budget | Constant |
|---|---|
| total class source | `TOTAL_BYTES`, 256 MiB |
| class declarations | `CLASSES`, 20,000 |
| member and relation records | `RECORDS`, 250,000 |
| detail text | `OUTPUT_TEXT`, 64 MiB |
| declaration registry text | `REGISTRY_TEXT`, 32 MiB |
| input size | 100,000 files / 1,000,000 symbols |

It also shares the catalog-wide `warnings` list (deduplicated, at most 100) and `truncated` flag. So a file's output depends on how much budget earlier files used. A file that grows can truncate or drop classes in a later, unchanged file.

#67 publishes native changes by writing only what changed. A pinned read must be byte-identical to a full rebuild, classes included, and single-file updates must meet a p95 (≤2 s medium, ≤5 s large) that includes class projection. Under the one-pass build, the only exact way to update classes is to re-parse every Java/Python file on every publication. That is O(workspace) work per edit.

`resolve()` binds no cross-file targets today: every relation is `unmatched`, with no target or candidates. So the shared budgets and warnings are the **only** cross-file dependency in the catalog.

## Decision

The catalog is built in two steps. Every limit is read from one `Limits` value. Production uses the constants above, and the fixture tests below use small limits. The warning strings below are shown with production values; their numbers are formatted from the active `Limits`.

### 1. Per-file extraction

- **Inputs.** A file's extraction is a function of only:
  - the file's bytes, path and language;
  - the file's measured `Symbol`s, including their captured SCIP display labels;
  - the **per-file** limits: `FILE_BYTES` (2 MiB), `FILE_CLASSES` (1,000), `FILE_REFS` (8,192), `MEMBERS` (256 per class), `VISITS` and detail visits (100,000), `DEPTH` (64), `TEXT` (2,048 bytes per string), and the type-parameter limits (256 per declaration and per scope).
- **No workspace budget.** It reads no workspace-wide budget and is never cut by one. `tick`, `details`, `reserve_text` and `reserve_detail_text` keep only their per-file checks. The registry and detail charges are **counted**, not refused.
- **Per-file messages are unchanged,** including `"{path}: class declaration limit reached (1000/file, 20000/catalog)"` when `FILE_CLASSES` is hit. That keeps below-cap output identical.
- **Result `F`.** Extraction produces:
  - `F.source_bytes`: the file's byte length. A file skipped by `FILE_BYTES` still has one, as today.
  - `F.registry_bytes`: the sum of every registry-text charge the extraction made. That is binding name plus value, class `id + name + path + qualified name`, and type-parameter scope text ×2. A file that declares **no** class still charges its bindings.
  - `F.warnings`: the file's own limit warnings, in emission order.
  - `F.truncated`: whether any per-file limit truncated output.
  - `F.registry_incomplete`: whether a per-file limit that today calls `registry_limit` fired (for example, no unique measured class symbol, an over-long qualified name, a type-parameter limit, or the work limit).
  - `F.classes`: the file's classes in `(start_byte, id)` order. Each class carries its declaration and its **detail items** (fields, methods, relations and detail type-parameter text) in extraction order. Each item has `records`: 1 for a member or relation, 0 for type-parameter text, and `text`: the bytes that `reserve_detail_text` charges.
- **Reuse.** `F` is stored with the document's **graph projection**, whose identity covers the document version and the file's measured `Symbol`s. `F` is reused exactly while that graph projection is reused, and recomputed whenever it changes. This includes an unchanged source file whose captured SCIP labels change.

### 2. Per-revision composition

- **Input limit.** If the revision has more than 100,000 files or 1,000,000 symbols, the catalog is empty, `truncated = true`, and `warnings` holds only the input-limit message, with no closing warnings. This is today's behaviour.
- **Otherwise,** walk the Java/Python files in ascending byte order of path. Start with counters `S` (source), `T` (registry text), `N` (classes), `R` (records) and `X` (detail text) at 0, and latches `registry_open` and `detail_open` set to true.
- **For each file `F`:**
  1. If `registry_open` is false, skip `F`. It contributes no classes and no warnings.
  2. **Registry caps.**
     - If `S + F.source_bytes > TOTAL_BYTES`, emit `"Class catalog source limit exceeded (256 MiB)"`. Otherwise, if `T + F.registry_bytes > REGISTRY_TEXT`, emit `"Class declaration registry text limit reached (32 MiB)"`. In either case, set `registry_open` false, mark the registry incomplete, and skip `F` and every later file.
     - Equality is admitted.
     - An excluded file's own warnings never enter the list.
  3. **Admit the file.** Add `F.source_bytes` to `S` and `F.registry_bytes` to `T`. Append `F.warnings` in order. If `F.truncated`, set the catalog's `truncated`.
  4. **For each class `c` of `F`, in order:**
     - If `N = CLASSES`, emit `"Class catalog declaration limit reached (20000)"`, set `registry_open` false, mark the registry incomplete, and stop. The rest of `F` and every later file are excluded; `F`'s warnings from step 3 stay.
     - Otherwise, admit `c`'s declaration and add 1 to `N`.
     - For each item `i` of `c`: admit it only if `detail_open`, `R + i.records ≤ RECORDS` and `X + i.text ≤ OUTPUT_TEXT`; then add `i.records` to `R` and `i.text` to `X`.
     - At the first item that fails, set `detail_open` false and emit one detail warning. If `R + i.records > RECORDS`, it is the record warning `"Class detail limit reached (250000 records / 64 MiB text / 100000 visits per file); declaration discovery continues"`. Otherwise it is the text warning `"Class detail text limit reached (64 MiB); declaration discovery continues"`. That item and every later item, in this class and every later class, are dropped. A class that loses at least one item is `truncated`.
     - Declarations keep being admitted after `detail_open` closes.
- **Warnings list.** Warnings are added in walk order and deduplicated by exact string. The first 100 distinct entries are kept and later ones are dropped silently.
- **Closing warnings.** After the walk, these follow, outside the 100-entry limit and in this order:
  1. `"Declared types are terminal source text…"`, if any class was admitted;
  2. `"Incomplete class declaration registry: some declarations may be absent."`, if the registry is incomplete. That is either a registry cap above, or an admitted file with `F.registry_incomplete` set.
- **Catalog `truncated`** is set when any cap above fires, or when an admitted file's `F.truncated` is set.
- **Output.**
  - Classes come out in `(path, start_byte, id)` order, and relations in `(path, start_byte, id)` order, deduplicated by `id`, as today.
  - Composition yields one **class projection per document** (its admitted classes and relations) plus the revision's catalog `warnings` and `truncated`.
  - Composition reads only the `F` values. It never re-parses.

`Catalog::build(files, nodes, cancel)` is defined as `compose(extract_file(f) for every file)` with production limits. #67's full-snapshot parity for classes is measured against that definition, not against the current one-pass output.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Keep the one-pass output exactly, and replay or re-parse to reproduce it.** Reproducing today's mid-class budget cutoffs and warning order on a delta needs every earlier file's extraction state. In practice that means re-parsing every Java/Python file, or replaying stored per-file extraction traces, on every publication. That is O(workspace) work per edit, against a p95 that includes class projection.
- **Exclude classes from parity or from the p95, or let class rows lag behind.** That contradicts #67's acceptance criteria.

## Consequences

- **Defined parity.** Delta publication and the full rebuild apply the same normative rules. The tests below check them against an independent build and against frozen expected outputs, not just against each other.
- **Delta writes.** A publication re-extracts only files whose graph projection changed: an edited file, or an unchanged file whose captured SCIP labels changed. Composition then rewrites only the class projections whose content changed: normally just those files'. Another document's projection changes only when a cap boundary moves across it.
- **Storage.** Per-file results live on the graph projection and per-document class projections are shared across revisions, so an unchanged file's class rows are stored once.
- **No resolution is added.** Every relation stays `unmatched`, as today. Binding relation targets across files would be a separate semantic decision.

## Behaviour change

Below every workspace-wide cap, output is identical to the current build. Frozen fixtures check this (see the tests below). At a cap, the rules above replace today's. Today:

- An overflowing registry-text charge drops one binding or class, and then every later node in the file and every later file stops, with a per-file "work limit" warning.
- Detail budgets are consumed in traversal order, interleaving nested classes.

Under this decision, registry caps exclude whole files, `CLASSES` cuts between classes, and detail caps cut at the first failing item, in class order. Nothing depends on the old cut points.

## Required tests (#67)

1. **Frozen below-cap outputs.** Before `classes.rs` changes, record the current one-pass `Catalog::build` output, byte-for-byte JSON, for the existing class fixtures and a below-cap sample of the #72 cohorts, and check it in. The new implementation must reproduce it exactly.
2. **Normative cap fixtures** with small `Limits` and checked-in expected outputs, written from the rules above and not generated by the implementation under test. For each of `TOTAL_BYTES`, `REGISTRY_TEXT`, `CLASSES`, `RECORDS`, `OUTPUT_TEXT` and the input limit:
   - **Boundary:** exactly at the limit (admitted) and one unit over (cut).
   - **Registry text without classes:** a file with no class whose bindings cross `REGISTRY_TEXT`.
   - **Detail cut inside a class:** a class whose items cross `RECORDS` and, separately, `OUTPUT_TEXT`. It keeps its declaration and its earlier items, is `truncated`, and later classes keep declarations without items.
   - **Excluded file's warnings:** they are absent from the list.
   - **Warning limit:** deduplication and the 100-entry limit, with the closing warnings after it in order.
   - **Moving cut:** growing an earlier file moves the cut in a later, unchanged file, and delta publication rewrites exactly that file's class projection.
3. **Independent oracle.**
   - #67's full-snapshot oracle builds the catalog in a fresh, isolated build. It re-extracts every file from the authenticated captured source and the revision's measured graph, and reads **no** stored `F`, graph projection or class projection.
   - It compares every pinned per-document class row, the order, the catalog `warnings` and `truncated`, byte-for-byte, with delta output after each #67 parity scenario.
4. **Cache invalidation.** An unchanged source file whose captured SCIP label changes gets a new graph projection, a recomputed `F` and the class projection that follows from it at the new revision, while an older retained pin still reads its exact previous rows.
5. **Workspace independence.** The same per-file inputs (bytes, path, language, measured `Symbol`s) give the same `F` in any workspace.

## Implementation impact

- **`src/classes.rs`.** Split into a per-file extraction (`extract_file`) and composition (`compose`), both taking `Limits`. `Catalog::build` becomes `compose` over `extract_file`. The global counters and refusals move out of extraction and into composition.
- **`src/store.rs` (#67 v8).**
  - `F` is stored on the document's graph projection and reused or recomputed with it.
  - Per-document class projections (`class_projections`, `classes`, `class_relations`) are named by each revision's manifest.
  - The catalog `warnings` and `truncated` move to the revision header.
  - Composition runs before the publication transaction, and the transaction writes only new projections.
- **`docs/class-diagram-contract.md`.** Its cap rule now points here.
- **#67 plan.** This is its `class-composition` slice. Selected-document attestation compares a path's stored projection against composition for the pinned revision.
